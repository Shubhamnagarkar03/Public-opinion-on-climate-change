# Public-opinion-on-climate-change

In the era of polarized debates surrounding climate change, opinions often emerge as impassioned expressions rather than objective analyses. In my recent study, I delved into a dataset sourced from Reddit, where individuals freely express their views on this contentious issue. Through meticulous analysis, I not only gauged sentiment attached to each opinion but also scrutinized the broader discourse surrounding climate change.

Join me as we navigate through the nuances of public opinion and unveil the multifaceted nature of the climate change discourse.
